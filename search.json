    "text": "Electric lights have benefited society immensely since their invention in 1879. Modern work, recreation, and transportation are made possible largely due to artificial lighting. However, when artificial outdoor lighting becomes inefficient and unnecessary, it is known as light pollution, with negative impacts on both wildlife and humans (Chepesiuk 2009).\nConcerns about the effects of light pollution on astronomy led to the 1988 formation of the nonprofit now known as DarkSky International (Hunter 2023). Since then, DarkSky has grown into a recognized global authority on light pollution with a mission to safeguard communities and wildlife against light pollution (DarkSky 2025a). The organization’s International Dark Sky Places program allows communities, parks, and protected areas to seek certification for efforts to preserve and protect their dark skies (DarkSky 2025b).\nNotably, Flagstaff, Arizona was the first International Dark Sky Place, designated in 2001. As a hub for astronomical observation, the city has been a leader in outdoor lighting policy since 1958 (Darksky 2015). Other cities, particularly those in the western US, have also recognized the need for measures to combat light pollution, and have achieved DarkSky certification. While certification is certainly not necessary for communities to implement outdoor lighting ordinances and other measures to curb light pollution, it is an indicator of places that have made dark sky conservation a priority.\nThis project aims to explore trends in nighttime light levels first from a national contiguous US perspective, and through more detailed case studies of individual cities."
