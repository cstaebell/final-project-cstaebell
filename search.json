    "text": "Electric lights have benefited society immensely since their invention in 1879. Modern work, recreation, and transportation are made possible largely due to artificial lighting. However, when artificial outdoor lighting becomes inefficient and unnecessary, it is known as light pollution, with negative impacts on both wildlife and humans [1].\nConcerns about the impacts of light pollution on astronomical observation led to the 1988 formation of the nonprofit now known as DarkSky International [2]. Since then, DarkSky has grown into a recognized global authority on light pollution with a mission to safeguard communities and wildlife against light pollution [3]. The organization’s International Dark Sky Places program allows communities, parks, and protected areas to seek certification for efforts to preserve and protect their dark skies [4]. While many communities implement outdoor lighting policies without seeking recognition, a DarkSky certification is an indicator of places that have made dark sky conservation a priority.\nThis project aims to explore trends in nighttime light levels first from a national contiguous US perspective, and through more detailed case studies of individual cities. Three DarkSky certified communities [4] with different sizes and designation dates have been selected:\n\nFlagstaff, Arizona: Population ~77,000, designated 2001;\nHomer Glen, Illinois: Population ~25,000, designated 2011;\nBee Cave, Texas: Population ~9,000, designated 2023.\n\nThese three communities were each paired with a community of similar size that has fewer, if any, ordinances controlling light pollution. Each community pair was examined to see if there are observable differences in nighttime radiance."

However, the Pair A cities, Flagstaff and Scranton, show decreasing tendencies. Also notable from this plot are the large differences in radiance values within pairs, despite controlling for population during the city selection process.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot of annual means\nggplot(data = all_pair_means) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_ntl, color = pair, linetype = group), linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ pair, labeller = labeller(pair = pair_names)) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Dark Sky\" = \"solid\", \"Comparison\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"A\" = \"firebrick\", \"B\" = \"royalblue3\", \"C\" = \"green4\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = expression(\"Mean Radiance (nW cm\"^-2~\"sr\"^-1*\")\"),\n       title = \"Mean Annual Radiance\",\n       linetype = \"City Type\",\n       color = \"Pair\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick look at the land use for Flagstaff compared to Scranton helps to explain the vast difference in mean nighttime lights between the two cities. Flagstaff contains much more undeveloped land like grassland and savannas, whereas most of Scranton is classified as urban and built up.\n\n\nCode\n# Sample comparison of land cover\nfs_lulc_plot &lt;- ggplot(flagstaff_lulc, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = landcover)) +\n  coord_quickmap() +\n  theme_light() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Flagstaff Land Cover\",\n       fill = NULL)\n  \nsc_lulc_plot &lt;- ggplot(scranton_lulc, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = landcover)) +\n  coord_quickmap() +\n  theme_light() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Scranton Land Cover\",\n       fill = NULL) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-75.7, -75.6, by = 0.05))\n\nfs_lulc_plot + sc_lulc_plot + plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") & theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the imbalances in land cover between different cities, restricting analysis to urban areas is a more effective means of comparison. (Proceeding this way introduces an assumption that any lighting policy effects outside of non-built-up areas are dwarfed by those on urban areas.) From the plots of urban mean radiance, we can see that the radiance for the Dark Sky Places is generally lower than for their paired cities.\n\n\nCode\n# Urban mean NTL plot\nggplot(data = all_pair_urban) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_urban_ntl, color = pair, linetype = group), linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ pair, labeller = labeller(pair = pair_names)) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Dark Sky\" = \"solid\", \"Comparison\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"A\" = \"firebrick\", \"B\" = \"royalblue3\", \"C\" = \"green4\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = expression(\"Mean Radiance (nW cm\"^-2~\"sr\"^-1*\")\"),\n       title = \"Mean Annual Radiance from Urban Areas\",\n       linetype = \"City Type\",\n       color = \"Pair\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the Wilcoxon test suggest that the observed differences between the Dark Sky communities and their Comparison counterparts are statistically significant.\n\n\n\nPair\np-value\n\n\n\n\nA\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nB\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nC\n0.00591\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of lighting policies\n\nPair A\nAs the home of two major observatories, Flagstaff has been at the forefront of outdoor lighting policy since 1958. The city’s lighting ordinance aims to encourage lighting practices and systems that will minimize light pollution and trespass while still maintaining nighttime safety, security, and productivity. The code includes comprehensive standards for maximum total outdoor light output, shielding requirements, time limits, sign illumination, and lamp types. [13]\nScranton’s Zoning Ordinance includes one short section devoted to lighting, which mainly focuses on curbing light trespass and nuisance glare. Maximum illumination levels are defined for two lighting levels. [14]\n\n\nPair B\nHomer Glen’s outdoor lighting ordinance is rooted in the desire to preserve rural character and aesthetic value. The ordinance establishes maximum light output and inclination for various outdoor lighting applications, permitted hours for lighting, shielding requirements, and bulb types. [15]\nSimilar to Scranton, Belvidere includes exterior lighting standards in their code of ordinances but does so for the purposes of promoting traffic safety and preventing nuisances. The ordinance sets limits on illumination intensity and hours of illumination outside of buildings, plus some requirements for light orientation and shielding. However, these provisions are not as strict or clearly defined as those in the Homer Glen ordinanace. [16]\n\n\nPair C\nBee Cave’s Unified Development Code contains a comprehensive lighting ordinance that appears similar to Flagstaff’s. The code addresses lighting controls, lumen caps, shielding and cut-off standards, sign illumination restrictions, and more. [17]\nThe code of ordinances for Clanton lacks a section devoted to lighting. Still, lights are mentioned in relation to other regulated items like signs and gas stations. The ordinance for gas stations includes a provision to prevent light trespass, but otherwise, outdoor lighting policy does not appear to be a priority for the city. [18]"

Data availability is one reason for this simplification – annual data is not available for all study areas for all years, and the MODIS science team urges caution when using land cover layers for 2021 and beyond due to lack of updates to the classification training database [11]. Therefore, 2019 data was used for all cities except for Clanton, which used 2020 data.↩︎"
