    "text": "Electric lights have benefited society immensely since their invention in 1879. Modern work, recreation, and transportation are made possible largely due to artificial lighting. However, when artificial outdoor lighting becomes inefficient and unnecessary, it is known as light pollution, with negative impacts on both wildlife and humans [1].\nConcerns about the impacts of light pollution on observational astronomy led to the 1988 formation of the nonprofit now known as DarkSky International [2]. Since then, DarkSky has grown into a recognized global authority on light pollution with a mission to safeguard communities and wildlife against light pollution [3]. The organization’s International Dark Sky Places program allows communities, parks, and protected areas to seek certification for efforts to preserve and protect their dark skies [4]. While many communities implement outdoor lighting policies without seeking recognition, a DarkSky certification is an indicator of places that have made dark sky conservation a priority.\nThis project aims to explore trends in nighttime light levels first from a national contiguous US perspective, and through more detailed case studies of individual cities. Three DarkSky certified communities [4] with different sizes and designation dates have been selected:\n\nFlagstaff, Arizona: Population ~77,000, designated 2001;\nHomer Glen, Illinois: Population ~25,000, designated 2011;\nBee Cave, Texas: Population ~9,000, designated 2023.\n\nThese three communities will each be paired with a community of similar size that has fewer, if any, ordinances controlling light pollution. Each community pair will be examined to see if there are observable differences in nighttime light emissions."

Texas, Montana, Idaho, and Utah all show particularly large increases upwards of 40%. More research is required to explain these trends, but possible drivers include recent population growth and urban development. On the other hand, several states have stayed fairly constant or even decreased over the 10-year span.\n\n\nCode\nst_pct_change_map &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_sf_interactive(data = filter(states_ntl, NAME != \"District of Columbia\"), \n                      aes(fill = pct_change,\n                          tooltip = paste(NAME, \"\\n\", round(pct_change, 1),\"%\", \n                                          \"\\n2014: \", round(ntl_2014, 2),\n                                          \"\\n2024: \", round(ntl_2024, 2)),\n                          data_id = NAME)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Arial\")) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"navy\", \n                       mid = \"white\",\n                       high = \"darkred\",\n                      midpoint = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Radiance Percent Change (2014 - 2024)\",\n       fill = \"% Change\",\n       caption = \"Data: NASA Black Marble & US Census Bureau\")\n\ngirafe(ggobj = st_pct_change_map,\n       options = list(opts_hover(css = \"stroke:black;stroke-width:2px\"),\n                 opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.8;\"),\n                 opts_tooltip(css = \"background-color:white;color:black;padding:15px;\n                                     border-radius:10px;\n                                     font-family:Arial;font-size:15px;\")))"

However, the Pair A cities, Flagstaff and Scranton, show decreasing tendencies. Also notable from this plot are the large differences in radiance values within pairs, despite controlling for population during the city selection process.\n\n\nCode\n# Create plot\nggplot(data = all_pair_means) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_ntl, color = pair, linetype = group), linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ pair, labeller = labeller(pair = pair_names)) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Dark Sky\" = \"solid\", \"Comparison\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"A\" = \"firebrick\", \"B\" = \"royalblue3\", \"C\" = \"green4\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = expression(\"Mean Radiance (nW cm\"^-2~\"sr\"^-1*\")\"),\n       title = \"Mean Annual Radiance\",\n       linetype = \"City Type\",\n       color = \"Pair\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick look at the land use for Flagstaff compared to Scranton helps to explain the vast difference in mean nighttime lights between the two cities. Flagstaff contains much more undeveloped land like grassland and savannas, whereas most of Scranton is classified as urban and built up.\n\n\nCode\nfs_lulc_plot &lt;- ggplot(flagstaff_lulc, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = landcover)) +\n  coord_quickmap() +\n  theme_light() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Flagstaff Land Cover\",\n       fill = NULL)\n  \nsc_lulc_plot &lt;- ggplot(scranton_lulc, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = landcover)) +\n  coord_quickmap() +\n  theme_light() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"Scranton Land Cover\",\n       fill = NULL) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-75.7, -75.6, by = 0.05))\n\nfs_lulc_plot + sc_lulc_plot + plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") & theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_tile()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the imbalances in land cover between different cities, restricting analysis to urban areas seems to be a more effective means of comparison. (Proceeding this way introduces an assumption that any lighting policy effects outside of non-built-up areas are dwarfed by those on urban areas.) From the plots of urban mean radiance, we can see that the radiance for the Dark Sky Places is generally lower than for their paired cities.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = all_pair_urban) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mean_urban_ntl, color = pair, linetype = group), linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ pair, labeller = labeller(pair = pair_names)) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(\"Dark Sky\" = \"solid\", \"Comparison\" = \"dashed\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"A\" = \"firebrick\", \"B\" = \"royalblue3\", \"C\" = \"green4\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = expression(\"Mean Radiance (nW cm\"^-2~\"sr\"^-1*\")\"),\n       title = \"Mean Annual Radiance from Urban Areas\",\n       linetype = \"City Type\",\n       color = \"Pair\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of lighting policies\nUse DarkSky certification application packets?\nFlagstaff’s Lighting Ordinance aims to encourage lighting practices and systems that will minimize light pollution and trespass, balance the conservation of energy with the maintenance of nighttime safety and productivity, and reduce degradation of the nighttime visual environment [13]. Low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps or narrow-spectrum amber LEDs are required in all Class 2 Lighting Areas. Decorative lighting must be included in the total lumen calculations for the site. Restrictions on total outdoor light output vary by zone and land use type (commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential vs single-family residential). Shielded light fixtures can be used to reduce contribution to total calculation. Shielding and proper aiming is also required to confine direct illumination from light fixtures to the property boundaries of the source (light trespass standard). Time limits for outdoor lighting - 9 or 11 pm or no later than 30 min after business closes. Street lighting standards in City Engineering Standards, Title 12. Holiday decorations - “low voltage holiday decorations may be unshielded and remain on all night from November 15 to January 15.” Standards for internally illuminated signs – cannot have a light background"

Data availability is one reason for this simplification – annual data is not available for all study areas for all years, and the MODIS science team urges caution when using land cover layers for 2021 and beyond due to lack of updates to the classification training database [11]. Therefore, 2019 data was used for all cities except for Clanton, which used 2020 data.↩︎"
