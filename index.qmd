# Introduction

Electric lights have benefited society immensely since their invention in 1879. Modern work, recreation, and transportation are made possible largely due to artificial lighting. However, when artificial outdoor lighting becomes inefficient and unnecessary, it is known as light pollution, with negative impacts on both wildlife and humans (Chepesiuk 2009). 

Concerns about the effects of light pollution on astronomy led to the 1988 formation of the nonprofit now known as DarkSky International (Hunter 2023). Since then, DarkSky has grown into a recognized global authority on light pollution with a mission to safeguard communities and wildlife against light pollution (DarkSky 2025a). The organization's International Dark Sky Places program allows communities, parks, and protected areas to seek certification for efforts to preserve and protect their dark skies (DarkSky 2025b). 

Notably, Flagstaff, Arizona was the first International Dark Sky Place, designated in 2001. As a hub for astronomical observation, the city has been a leader in outdoor lighting policy since 1958 (Darksky 2015). Other cities, particularly those in the western US, have also recognized the need for measures to combat light pollution, and have achieved DarkSky certification. While certification is certainly not necessary for communities to implement outdoor lighting ordinances and other measures to curb light pollution, it is an indicator of places that have made dark sky conservation a priority. 

This project aims to explore trends in nighttime light levels first from a national contiguous US perspective, and through more detailed case studies of individual cities. 

# Materials and methods

Three Dark Sky Certified communities with different sizes and designation dates have been selected: 

* Flagstaff, Arizona: Population ~77,000, designated 2001;
* Homer Glen, Illinois: Population ~25,000, designated 2011;
* Bee Cave, Texas: Population ~9,000, designated 2023.

These three communities will each be paired with a community of similar size that has fewer, if any, ordinances controlling light pollution. Each community pair will be examined to see if there are observable differences in nighttime light emissions.

Data are sourced from NASA's Black Marble annual nighttime lights product, MODIS yearly land use/land cover, and the US Census.

## Download and clean all required data

The nighttime lights raster and extracted values for the entire US take a while to download, so I had planned to include the following code which writes the data to files that can be loaded individually. But the files are somewhat large and I broke my original github build when I committed the update containing them. (There was probably another issue causing the build failure but the files are larger than recommended for storage in the data folder, anyway.)

```{r US Black Marble Data, eval = F}
# Download and save CONUS black marble data. 

# Define region of interest
nonconus <- c("Guam", "Hawaii", "Alaska",
              "Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands",
              "United States Virgin Islands", "American Samoa", "Puerto Rico")
states_sf <- states() |>
  filter(!NAME %in% nonconus) |>
  select(NAME, geometry) |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326") # EPSG:4326 for compatibility with black marble

# Nighttime lights annual data (black marble)
bm_annual <- bm_raster(roi_sf = states_sf,
                      product_id = "VNP46A4",
                      date = c(2012,2024),
                      bearer = nasa_bearer_token) |> terra::mask(states_sf)

writeRaster(bm_annual, filename = "data/blackmarble_us_2012_2024.tif")

# Create log transformed version for mapping
app(bm_annual, fun = log1p, filename = "data/log_blackmarble_us_2012_2024.tif", overwrite = TRUE)

# values
ntl_2012_2024 <- bm_extract(roi_sf = states_sf,
                         product_id = "VNP46A4",
                         date = 2012:2024, 
                         bearer = nasa_bearer_token)

write.csv(ntl_2012_2024, "data/bm_vals_states_2012to2024.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

The following code was used to generate a national nighttime lights figure (embedded below, saved from previous). Further national analysis was planned, but I need to figure out how to store and access the data.


```{r plot black marble, eval = F}
us_2024 <- ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = log_bm_us[[2]]) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "black",
                       mid = "yellow", 
                       high = "red",
                       midpoint = 4.5,
                       na.value = "transparent") +
  labs(title = "Nighttime Lights: 2024") +
  coord_sf() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  

log_diff_us <- ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = us_log_diff, aes(fill = log_diff)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue",
                       mid = "gray95",
                       high = "red",
                       midpoint = 0,
                       na.value = "transparent") +
  labs(title = "Nighttime Lights Log Difference between 2024 and 2012",
       fill = "Log Difference", subtitle = NULL) +
  coord_sf() +
  theme_void()

us_ntl <- us_2024 / log_diff_us 

```

For case study analyses, population data and local geographies were downloaded from the US Census.

```{r download census data, warning = F, message = F, output = F}

# Download population data
us_pop <- get_acs(geograph = "place", state = NULL, 
                  variables = "B01003_001", key = census_api_key)

az_pop <- get_acs(geography = "place", state = "AZ", 
                         variables = "B01003_001", key = census_api_key)

il_pop <- get_acs(geography = "place", state = "IL", 
                         variables = "B01003_001", key = census_api_key)

tx_pop <- get_acs(geography = "place", state = "TX", 
                         variables = "B01003_001", key = census_api_key)

# Download local geographies: selected Dark Sky Places
flagstaff <- places(state = "AZ", cb = TRUE, year = 2024) |>
  filter(NAME == "Flagstaff") |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326") |>
  left_join(us_pop, by = "GEOID")

homerglen <- places(state = "IL", cb = TRUE, year = 2024) |>
  filter(NAME == "Homer Glen") |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326") |>
  left_join(us_pop, by = "GEOID")

beecave <- places(state = "TX", cb = TRUE, year = 2024) |>
  filter(NAME == "Bee Cave") |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326") |>
  left_join(us_pop, by = "GEOID")

```

Cities of similar population size were found for each selected Dark-Sky community. The city selection process focused on states that do not have laws regarding light pollution or dark sky protection, as compiled by Schultz (2022).

```{r process census data, message = F, output = F}

# Find suitable comparison cities
flagstaff_sim_pop <- us_pop |> filter(estimate >= (flagstaff$estimate - 0.01*flagstaff$estimate) 
                                & estimate <= (flagstaff$estimate + 0.01*flagstaff$estimate)) |>
  separate(NAME, into = c("city", "state"), sep = ", ")

homerglen_sim_pop <- us_pop |> filter(estimate >= (homerglen$estimate - 0.005*homerglen$estimate) 
                                & estimate <= (homerglen$estimate + 0.005*homerglen$estimate)) |>
  separate(NAME, into = c("city", "state"), sep = ", ")

beecave_sim_pop <- us_pop |> filter(estimate >= (beecave$estimate - 0.005*beecave$estimate) 
                                & estimate <= (beecave$estimate + 0.005*beecave$estimate)) |>
  separate(NAME, into = c("city", "state"), sep = ", ")

# Download/process comparison city data
 # Flagstaff counterpart
scranton <- places(state = "PA", cb = TRUE, year = 2024) |>
  filter(NAME == "Scranton") |>
  left_join(us_pop, by = "GEOID") |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326")

 # Homer Glen counterpart
belvidere <- places(state = "IL", cb = TRUE, year = 2024) |>
  filter(NAME == "Belvidere") |>
  left_join(us_pop, by = "GEOID") |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326")

 # Bee Cave counterpart
clanton <- places(state = "AL", cb = TRUE, year = 2024) |>
  filter(NAME == "Clanton") |>
  left_join(us_pop, by = "GEOID") |>
  st_transform(crs = "epsg:4326")

```
There are issues downloading nighttime lights data in real time when rendering. So, I made small raster files of the downloaded black marble data.

```{r download and process local nighttime lights data, eval = F}

flagstaff_bm <- bm_raster(roi_sf = flagstaff,
                      product_id = "VNP46A4",
                      date = c(2012,2016,2020,2024),
                      bearer = nasa_bearer_token) |> terra::mask(flagstaff)

writeRaster(flagstaff_bm, filename = "data/flagstaff_bm.tif")

scranton_bm <- bm_raster(roi_sf = scranton,
                      product_id = "VNP46A4",
                      date = c(2012,2016,2020,2024),
                      bearer = nasa_bearer_token) |> terra::mask(scranton)

writeRaster(scranton_bm, filename = "data/scranton_bm.tif")
```

```{r load and process local nighttime lights data, message = F, warning = F}

flagstaff_bm_rast <- rast("data/flagstaff_bm.tif")
scranton_bm_rast <- rast("data/scranton_bm.tif")

plot(flagstaff_bm_rast)
plot(scranton_bm_rast)

# calculate mean normalized radiance
flagstaff_area_km <- flagstaff$ALAND / 1000^2
scranton_area_km <- scranton$ALAND / 1000^2

scranton_rad <- data.frame(values(scranton_bm_rast)) |>
  summarize(across(t2012:t2024, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = t2012:t2024, names_to = "year", values_to = "sc_mean") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(sub("t", "", year)),
         sc_a_norm_mean = sc_mean / scranton_area_km)

flagstaff_rad <- data.frame(values(flagstaff_bm_rast)) |>
  summarize(across(t2012:t2024, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = t2012:t2024, names_to = "year", values_to = "fs_mean") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(sub("t", "", year)),
         fs_a_norm_mean = fs_mean / flagstaff_area_km)

flagstaff_comp_df <- flagstaff_rad |>
  select(-fs_mean) |>
  mutate(sc_a_norm_mean = scranton_rad$sc_a_norm_mean)
 # ^ huge discrepancy suggests need to also normalize by land use (and maybe population)

```

MODIS data was downloaded via AppEEARS. The proportion of land classified as urban and built-up was calculated and applied as a coefficient to the land area, which was then used to normalize the mean radiance. At this point, the analysis was only done for Flagstaff, AZ, and its paired city of Scranton, PA.


```{r land use data}

# define land cover descriptions
Land_Cover_Type_1 <- c(
  "Water" = 0, "Evergreen Needleleaf forest" = 1, "Evergreen Broadleaf forest" = 2,
  "Deciduous Needleleaf forest" = 3, "Deciduous Broadleaf forest" = 4, "Mixed forest" = 5,
  "Closed shrublands" = 6, "Open shrublands" = 7, "Woody savannas" = 8, "Savannas" = 9,
  "Grasslands" = 10, "Permanent wetlands" = 11, "Croplands" = 12, "Urban & built-up" = 13,
  "Cropland/Natural vegetation mosaic" = 14, "Snow & ice" = 15, "Barren/Sparsely vegetated" = 16
)

lcd <- data.frame(
  ID = Land_Cover_Type_1,
  landcover = names(Land_Cover_Type_1),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# calculate urban/built-up area 

fs_lulc <- rast("data/MCD12Q1.061_LC_Type1_doy2024001000000_aid0001-fs.tif") |>
  crop(flagstaff) |>
  mask(flagstaff)

levels(fs_lulc) <- lcd
plot(fs_lulc, main = "Land Use in Flagstaff, AZ")

fs_type_summary <- data.frame(values(fs_lulc)) |>
  drop_na() |>
  group_by(landcover) |>
  summarize(tot_pixels = n())

fs_prop_urban <- fs_type_summary[4,2] / sum(fs_type_summary[,2])
names(fs_prop_urban) <- "prop_urban"

sc_lulc <- rast("data/MCD12Q1.061_LC_Type1_doy2024001000000_aid0001-sc.tif") |>
  crop(scranton) |>
  mask(scranton)
levels(sc_lulc) <- lcd
plot(sc_lulc, main = "Land Use in Scranton, PA")

sc_type_summary <- data.frame(values(sc_lulc)) |>
  drop_na() |>
  group_by(landcover) |>
  summarize(tot_pixels = n())

sc_prop_urban <- sc_type_summary[4,2] / sum(sc_type_summary[,2])
names(sc_prop_urban) <- "prop_urban"

```

The following chunk works locally but will not render; I'm still figuring this out.

```{r land use process2, eval = F}

# calculate mean normalized radiance
flagstaff_urban_km <- (flagstaff$ALAND * fs_prop_urban / 1000^2)[1,1]
scranton_urban_km <- (scranton$ALAND * sc_prop_urban / 1000^2)[1,1]

scranton_rad <- data.frame(values(scranton_bm_rast)) |>
  summarize(across(t2012:t2024, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = t2012:t2024, names_to = "year", values_to = "rad_mean") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(sub("t", "", year)),
         a_norm_mean = rad_mean / scranton_urban_km, 
         city = "Scranton")

flagstaff_rad <- data.frame(values(flagstaff_bm_rast)) |>
  summarize(across(t2012:t2024, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = t2012:t2024, names_to = "year", values_to = "rad_mean") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(sub("t", "", year)),
         a_norm_mean = rad_mean / flagstaff_urban_km,
         city = "Flagstaff")

flagstaff_comp_df <- flagstaff_rad |>
  bind_rows(scranton_rad)

ggplot(flagstaff_comp_df) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = a_norm_mean)) +
  facet_wrap(~ city) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Urban Area Normalized Mean Radiance",
       title = "Annual Mean Radiance Normalized by Urban Area")

```

# Open questions/further exploration: 

* Look into land use for each year of nighttime lights data, but for now I'm operating under the assumption that land use has not changed significantly between 2012 and 2024.

* Reconsider order of analysis. Instead of taking mean of entire study area and then applying urban area correction, restrict area of interest for nighttime lights data to urban areas, get mean and then normalize by area?

* See if conclusions can be drawn after all cities are processed. This includes looking at the lighting policies in each city. 

* Some cities are switching from orange high pressure sodium lamps to white LEDs. VIIRS spectral range does not completely cover the blue light peak of many modern white LEDs, which can lead to somewhat misleading decreases in satellite-observed radiance.
